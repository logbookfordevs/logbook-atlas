# Compose a workflow

Choose the next skill by what remains unresolved. If the behavior is already agreed, start implementation. If the code is ready, start review. A longer chain is useful only when each step answers a real question or preserves something the next step needs.

The [skill guide](catalog-guide.md) helps you choose individual tools. This chapter explains how they work together.

<h2 id="workflows-composition">Small skills, named compositions</h2>

AFK's composition model borrows the intuition of React components: small pieces can be reused inside a named whole. This is a way to describe agent behavior; no React runtime executes the skills.

| Role | Job | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primitive | Supply a reusable practice. | `grilling` challenges assumptions; `tdd` develops behavior test-first. |
| Wrapper | Apply practices to a narrower job. | `afk-code-grill` focuses grilling on technical choices. |
| Workflow | Own several stages, state, or approval points. | `afk-implement` tracks work through validation and acceptance. |
| Utility | Perform a bounded supporting task. | `afk-ask` captures a second opinion. |
| Reference | Supply knowledge another skill can consult. | Shared vocabulary or decision guidance. |
| Router | Choose or load the right instructions. | `afk-compass` recommends a route; `afk-profile-use` loads a working set. |

In the catalog, `role` describes that shape and `composes` lists the skills a composition builds on. For example:

```text
afk-code-grill
├── grilling             asks the hard questions
├── truss-evaluation     evaluates consequential trade-offs
└── codebase-design      supplies module and interface vocabulary
```

AFK setup warns about and includes declared composed dependencies when you select a parent skill. At runtime, the agent follows the skill instructions; `composes` is not an execution scheduler or a guarantee that every skill mentioned in prose is installed. Direct installation from a repository also does not apply AFK's catalog dependency selection.

Invocation policy is independent of composition. A manually invoked wrapper can use a primitive without making the whole wrapper an automatic response to every task. A profile groups available instructions; it does not prescribe their execution order.

<h2 id="workflows-feature">Example: take a feature from questions to accepted code</h2>

Suppose you want to add saved filters to an existing dashboard. Users should save a filter, return later, and restore it. Storage, sharing, and empty-state behavior are still undecided.

| Step | Use | Decision or handoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Settle the behavior | `grill-with-docs` or `afk-code-grill` | Decide ownership, persistence, constraints, and testable behavior. Use the docs route when vocabulary and ADRs need recording. |
| 2. Capture the agreement | `afk-to-spec` | Preserve the behavior, trade-offs, exclusions, and testing decisions. |
| 3. Slice if useful | `afk-to-tickets` | Agree independently verifiable tickets and their blockers, such as saving one filter before adding sharing. |
| 4. Implement the next unblocked slice | `afk-implement` | Choose local or remote tracking, record execution evidence, and complete the review gate. |
| 5. Accept or request changes | User review | Confirm the result, including behavior or visual evidence that automated review cannot decide for you. |

These are separate requests, made when the preceding work is ready:

```text
Use afk-code-grill to settle the saved-filter behavior and technical choices.
Use afk-to-spec to capture the decisions we have agreed.
Use afk-to-tickets to propose independently verifiable slices from that spec.
Use afk-implement for the first unblocked ticket, using the linked spec.
```

Ticket writing waits for approval of the breakdown and destination. Implementation asks where its tracking record should live, validates the selected development disciplines, and runs `afk-code-review` after implementation-owned changes are committed. Its status stays in review until you accept the checkpoint. You do not need to run a second code review just because the sequence reaches its last row.

For one bounded change, skip tickets and implement from the spec. For a tiny edit, skip durable implementation tracking unless you want it. If the conversation already establishes the behavior, skip grilling. `afk-to-spec` records known decisions; it cannot make unresolved product choices disappear.

<h2 id="workflows-design">Example: settle a frontend direction</h2>

Use `afk-design-grill` when the visual direction is still open. It makes consequential choices visible and records the selected reference, what must be preserved, and what implementation may adapt.

Choose an experiment for the remaining question:

- **Hierarchy or navigation:** use `html-wireframe` to judge structure without polish.
- **A state model or behavior inside an existing product:** use `prototype` for a bounded experiment.
- **A polished standalone surface or interactive flow:** use `html-prototype` when the artifact needs enough fidelity to approve visually.

Bring the selected reference and visual commitment into the spec or implementation ticket. A useful handoff says which frames, viewports, and states are authoritative. “Make it look like the prototype” leaves too much to interpretation.

If an external design is already approved, begin from that reference and its constraints. Reopen direction only when a material unresolved choice requires it.

<h2 id="workflows-cinematic">Example: produce a cinematic frontend</h2>

Use `afk-animated-driven-frontend` when pacing, motion, and cinematic direction carry the experience. The user and agent act as co-directors, approving production stages with rendered evidence.

The broad order is **development → treatment → preproduction → production → rough-cut screening and picture lock → post-production → delivery**. It is an iterative production process: a risky shot may need a real tracer implementation before the next decision can be made.

The production binder preserves creative continuity across sessions. Its director's notebook indexes approved choices, rejected directions, open questions, and evidence. When several approved cuts are ready for independent work, use `afk-to-tickets` to schedule that frontier and `afk-implement` to track execution. Keep creative greenlights in the binder and validation/review state in the Implementation Record, linked together.

The [ADF Cinematic Production Map](https://tot.page/BKxaG-aUkUFc5f180RsQ4Q) is the visual companion for stages, artifacts, and greenlights. Start there if the film-production vocabulary is unfamiliar.

<h2 id="workflows-other-routes">Other useful entry points</h2>

| Situation | Suggested order | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A bug with an unknown cause | `diagnosing-bugs` → fix with appropriate tests → review | Establish the cause before committing to a solution. Use tracked implementation when the fix warrants it. |
| A large, interdependent planning problem | `wayfinder` → focused research, grilling, or prototypes → implementation planning | Wayfinder resolves a shared decision map; implementation tickets organize work whose decisions are ready. |
| A finished change needs scrutiny | `afk-static-review` and `afk-code-review` | Static checks and intent review answer different questions. Neither is user acceptance. |
| Findings need adjudication before fixes | `afk-code-review-verdicts` → discussion → approved fixes | The wrapper runs the review itself, then verifies its findings. |
| Framework behavior is uncertain | `research` or `source-driven-development` → implementation | Preserve the source and version assumptions that justify the choice. |
| A difficult decision needs another view | `afk-ask` or `clean-room` → reconcile the evidence | A second opinion is input to judgment, not automatic authority. |
| The next session needs to continue | `handoff` → resume from the linked source and current record | Carry decisions, evidence, blockers, and the next unresolved step. |

Use `afk-architect` when bounded work benefits from independent agent ownership. Use `orchestrator` when coordination needs separate processes or runtimes. Neither replaces the selected specialist's instructions or the user's approval gates.

<h2 id="workflows-handoffs">What survives between skills</h2>

A skill sequence works when each step can recover the decisions it depends on. Preserve the smallest useful artifact and link to it rather than copying every document into every subsequent one.

| Artifact | What it carries |
| --- | --- |
| Spec | Intended behavior, constraints, accepted trade-offs, testing decisions, and exclusions. |
| Visual commitment | The approved reference, must-preserve details, permitted adaptations, and evidence required for visual acceptance. |
| Ticket | One executable slice, source references, blockers, acceptance criteria, and test seam. |
| Implementation Record | Current execution state, validation evidence, review findings, and handoff notes. |
| Production binder | Creative continuity and approved greenlights across cinematic cuts or sessions. |

Follow the repository's artifact conventions. Decide explicitly when a remote tracker owns a record. For example, a ticket's “implemented” note is an execution claim; a reviewer still checks the code against the originating spec.
