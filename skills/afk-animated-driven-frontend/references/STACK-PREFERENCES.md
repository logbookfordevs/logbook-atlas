# Stack Preferences

Inspect the repository before selecting tools. Reuse its headless foundation, styling system, renderer, animation stack, audio bus, and input utilities when they fit the approved shot and reference bar. Introduce one owner per concern.

## Runtime ownership guide

Use this guide only after the medium scout establishes the creative master. It minimizes accidental overlap inside a chosen production route; it is not a ladder that makes ambition justify itself from CSS upward.

| Need | First choice | Escalate when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSS state feedback | CSS transitions / keyframes | sequencing or interruption becomes stateful |
| React choreography | `motion/react` | a long authored timeline or render-loop integration is central |
| Framework-agnostic motion | `motion` or Web Animations API | the project already owns a stronger timeline system |
| Timeline and scroll sequence | GSAP | existing project primitives already solve it cleanly |
| Authored 2D or Canvas world | existing Canvas or 2D engine; otherwise choose from the medium scout | DOM/CSS cannot carry the approved material, scale, or composition |
| Spatial or shader world | existing Three.js stack; otherwise Three.js or React Three Fiber according to architecture | DOM/CSS cannot express the required scene or effect |
| Externally authored performance | existing asset runtime; otherwise the approved export or runtime | live browser production adds no meaningful agency or weakens art direction |
| Simple UI sound | existing audio layer or a small hook | scheduling, sprites, mixing, or spatial audio requires a dedicated engine such as Howler |
| Haptics | platform API or existing wrapper | richer device support is justified and degrades cleanly |
| Hotkeys | existing command system | scoped chords, discovery, and conflict handling justify a library |

Import from `motion` or `motion/react`, not `framer-motion`.

## Curated sources

When the user, organization, or repository provides a curated library of tools, assets, sound sources, or production references, search it before adding a dependency or inventing a new pipeline. Curated options remain candidates rather than mandates; apply the dependency gate and verify licensing, delivery, accessibility, and target-device cost.

## Ownership rules

- Keep DOM choreography and WebGL rendering in separate owners joined by semantic state or normalized progress.
- Keep per-frame values out of React state; use motion values, refs, external stores, or the renderer’s loop.
- Avoid overlapping animation engines inside one component subtree unless their boundary is explicit.
- Keep one audio clock and one mute/preference owner.
- Keep input normalization separate from scene interpretation.
- Express motion tokens in the project’s existing token system.

## Dependency gate

Before adding a package, confirm:

1. the repository does not already provide the capability;
2. the package owns a distinct concern rather than duplicating another engine;
3. its bytes and runtime work fit the opening and steady-state budgets;
4. it supports target browsers, SSR boundaries, reduced motion, and cleanup;
5. the project’s current package manager and version policy are followed.

Three.js, GLSL, GSAP, Howler, DRACO, and Vite formed ZERO’s proven stack. They are evidence of a coherent composition, not a cargo-cult recipe.
