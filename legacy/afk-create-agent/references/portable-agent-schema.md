# Portable Custom Agent Schema

Use this reference while authoring a Portable Agent File or its catalog entry.

## Catalog entry

`agents.json` contains presentation metadata and a direct source:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "notion_assistant",
      "label": "Notion Assistant",
      "source": "agents/notion_assistant.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `id` owns catalog selection and the installed filename; it may differ from
  the portable file's harness-facing `name`.
- `label` is presentation text; the portable file owns runtime description and
  behavior.
- `source` is an HTTP(S) URL, absolute path, or path relative to the selected
  catalog source root. A cache entry without source context falls back to the
  setup working directory.
- Custom Agents have no default-selection field. Interactive setup starts with
  every item unchecked; scripts select with `--custom-agent` or `--all`.

Refresh merges `agents.json` by ID: incoming matches replace cached entries,
new entries append, and cached entries absent from the source survive.
During source loading, AFK materializes relative agent paths as absolute paths
for local repositories and raw-file URLs for GitHub repositories.

## Portable Agent File

The source is Markdown with YAML frontmatter followed by a non-empty instruction
body:

```markdown
---
name: notion_assistant
description: Works with Notion content while preserving existing data.
models:
  codex: gpt-5.6-luna
  claude: claude-sonnet-5
  pi: openai/gpt-5.6
effort:
  codex: medium
  claude: medium
  pi: medium
nicknames:
  - Notion Scout
  - Workspace Librarian
skills:
  - notion-cli
  - logbook-notion-context
access: workspace-write
capabilities:
  required:
    - read
    - search
  optional:
    - write
    - web
---

Use the Notion CLI and preserve existing content.
```

## Fields

| Field | Required | Contract |
|---|---:|---|
| `name` | Yes | Stable identity matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$`. Claude renders underscores as hyphens. |
| `description` | Yes | Delegation guidance describing when the harness should use the agent. |
| `models` | No | Non-empty exact model identifier or native alias keyed by `codex`, `claude`, or `pi`. Omission inherits. |
| `effort` | No | Non-empty native effort or thinking value keyed by harness. Omission inherits. |
| `nicknames` | No | Unique non-empty ASCII names using letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, or underscores. |
| `skills` | No | Unique non-empty shared AFK skill names attached through native agent configuration. |
| `access` | No | `read-only` or `workspace-write`. Omission leaves access under harness control. |
| `capabilities.required` | No | Facilities every selected target must provide; a missing requirement skips that target. |
| `capabilities.optional` | No | Facilities AFK may omit while still provisioning and reporting the omission. |
| Markdown body | Yes | Runtime instructions for the fresh-context agent. |

`read-only` cannot require `write`.

## Harness translation

| Portable field | Codex | Claude Code | Pi with `pi-subagents` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `models` | `model` | `model` | `model` |
| `effort` | `model_reasoning_effort` | `effort` | `thinking` |
| `nicknames` | `nickname_candidates` | Reported as omitted | Reported as omitted |
| `skills` | One enabled `[[skills.config]]` path per skill under `~/.agents/skills` | Native `skills` list | Native `skills` plus absolute `skillPath` entries under `~/.agents/skills` |
| `access: read-only` | `sandbox_mode` | `permissionMode: plan` and denied write tools | Read-only tool selection |
| Instruction body | `developer_instructions` | Markdown body | Markdown body |

AFK translates skill declarations without installing, enabling, inspecting, or
verifying the referenced skill folders. The harness owns missing-skill warnings
and runtime behavior.

## Capabilities

V1 recognizes `read`, `search`, `shell`, `write`, `web`, and `subagents`.

| Harness | Supported capabilities |
|---|---|
| Codex | `read`, `search`, `shell`, `write`, `web`, `subagents` |
| Claude Code | `read`, `search`, `shell`, `write`, `web`, `subagents` |
| Pi | `read`, `search`, `shell`, `write`, `subagents` |

For Pi, `read-only` also makes `shell` and `write` unavailable. Unknown or
unsupported required capabilities block that target. Unknown or unsupported
optional capabilities are reported and omitted.

## Generated targets

| Harness | Personal scope | Project scope |
|---|---|---|
| Codex | `~/.codex/agents/<name>.toml` | `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md` | `.claude/agents/<name>.md` |
| Pi | `~/.pi/agent/agents/<name>.md` | `.pi/agents/<name>.md` |

Setup replaces selected generated files with a fresh translation. Durable edits
belong in the portable source. Pi provisioning requires `pi-subagents`; AFK
suggests `pi install npm:pi-subagents`, skips Pi, and asks for a setup rerun when
the extension is unavailable.
