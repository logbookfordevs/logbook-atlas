disable-model-invocation: false
---

Two-axis review of the requested branch, PR, commit, or working-tree changes:

- **Standards** - does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** - does the code faithfully implement the originating issue, spec, or implementation ticket?

Both axes should run in parallel sub-agents or fresh contexts so they do not pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

## Process

### 1. Pin the review scope

Resolve the requested scope before collecting evidence:

- **Branch or PR:** use the supplied base or PR base and `git diff <base>...HEAD`; record commits with `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline`.
- **Commit:** inspect the specified commit's change; resolve the intended parent comparison for a merge commit.
- **Working tree:** include staged changes (`git diff --cached`), unstaged changes (`git diff`), and relevant untracked files (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`). Inspect untracked file contents directly; Git diffs omit them.

Reuse the scope supplied by the user or PR metadata. Ask only when multiple interpretations remain materially different. Verify refs resolve, record the exact comparison commands and file inventory, and report an empty scope without launching reviewers. An empty tracked diff alone does not establish an empty working-tree scope.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.), PR metadata, branch names, or user-provided context.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A spec under the active artifact convention or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. Use the user request as intent when available. If no spec or intent source can be found, complete Standards review and state the Spec coverage gap. Ask only when missing intent prevents a material judgment.

When the reviewed change implements a tracked ticket, include its tracking home alongside the originating issue, spec, or user request. Follow the ticket's source references to the originating material when available.

Treat the originating material as authoritative for intent, the implementation ticket's requirements as the declared scope of the current slice, and its implementation and evidence statements as claims the reviewer must substantiate against the diff, code, and available evidence. Report relevant requirements lost or distorted between the originating material and the ticket, while distinguishing requirements assigned to other tickets or deliberately outside the reviewed slice.

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below - a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation - and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* -> *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name** - a function, variable, or type whose name does not reveal what it does or holds. -> rename it; if no honest name comes, the design is murky.
- **Duplicated Code** - the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. -> extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** - a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. -> move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** - the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). -> bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** - a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. -> give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** - the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. -> replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** - one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. -> gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** - one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. -> split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** - abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec does not have. -> delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** - long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller should not depend on. -> hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** - a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. -> cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** - a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. -> drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Spawn both sub-agents in parallel

Prefer `pathfinder` or a comparably capable native teammate with high reasoning effort for both axes. Choose by model capability and the judgment required; read-only access or a high effort setting alone does not establish review suitability. Reserve `cartographer` for evidence gathering or a narrow, straightforward Standards review. Spec review that requires tracing behavior, reconciling requirements, or judging implementation correctness should use the stronger reviewer.

**Standards sub-agent prompt** - include:

- The exact comparison commands, applicable commit list, and file inventory, including relevant untracked files.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full; the reviewer has no other access to it.
- The brief: "Report, per file/hunk where relevant: (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard, citing the standard file and rule; and (b) any baseline smell you spot, naming it and quoting the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls. Documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** - include:

- The exact comparison commands, applicable commit list, and file inventory, including relevant untracked files.
- The path or fetched contents of the originating material and, when present, the implementation ticket and its tracking record.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the originating material or implementation ticket asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behavior in the diff that was not asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong; (d) relevant requirements lost or distorted between the originating material and the ticket, excluding requirements assigned to other tickets or deliberately outside this slice; and (e) implementation or evidence claims in `Changes`, `Verification`, `Discipline Evidence`, or material `Implementation Notes` that are unsupported, inaccurate, incomplete, or contradicted by the diff, code, or available evidence. Quote the source line or tracking-record section for each finding. Under 400 words."

If both the spec and other intent sources are missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this coverage gap in the final report.

### 5. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings - the two axes are deliberately separate (see _Why two axes_).

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). Do not pick a single winner across axes - that is the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing -> **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions -> **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
